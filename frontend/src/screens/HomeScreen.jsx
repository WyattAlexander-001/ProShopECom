/*
This is a Bootstrap grid column component. The numbers inside the curly braces represent the number of columns this element should span on different screen sizes, based on Bootstrap's 12-column grid system.

- sm={12}: On small screens (like smartphones), the element will take up all 12 columns, effectively taking up the full width of the screen.
- md={6}: On medium screens (like tablets), the element will take up 6 out of 12 columns, effectively taking up half the width of the screen.
- lg={4}: On large screens (like laptops), the element will take up 4 out of 12 columns, effectively taking up a third of the width of the screen.
- xl={3}: On extra large screens (like desktop monitors), the element will take up 3 out of 12 columns, effectively taking up a quarter of the width of the screen.

This setup allows for a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
